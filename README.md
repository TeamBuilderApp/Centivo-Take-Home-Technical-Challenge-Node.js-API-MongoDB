# Centivo Coding Challenge.

A simple admin panel that manages user data for the Centivo take-home test. Uses HTTP Web API methods, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to manage users. Made using Node.js Express API that connects to a MongoDB database and retrieves user data.








FAQ:

How do I use MongoDB with Express JS?
The MongoDB Driver is the native driver for Node JS applications. Therefore, the Express JS server can use it to access MongoDB.

How do I create a REST API using Node Express JS and MongoDB?
A REST API can be created by setting up an Express server with connection to MongoDB Atlas, as well as exposing REST API endpoints to the client applications.

Install MongoDB Driver. 
Call node \create_MongoDB\createMongoDB.js this will create the DB if it does not already exist.
Also note that, in MongoDB, a database is not created until it gets content! 
MongoDB waits until you have created a collection (table), with at least one document (record) before it actually creates the database (and collection).
